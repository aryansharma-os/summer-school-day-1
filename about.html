                Hello! My name is Aryan Sharma and I'm from Jammu, currently pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering from Lovely Professional University, Jalandhar. I am  passionate about technology and enjoy building websites as part of my web development journey. Along with coding, I also have skills in video editing, which allows me to express creativity in multiple formats. I'm eager to keep learning and growing in both tech and media.
